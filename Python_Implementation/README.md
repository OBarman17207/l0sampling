# l0sampling

A python implementation of l_0 sampling

l_0 sampling is a space efficient algorithm that returns a near uniform random sample from an insertion-deletion stream.


## Downloading dependencies

To run the l0_sampler first install dependencies with pip or through Anaconda.

Anaconda is heavily recommended since downloading and using these dependencies is hassle free with it.


## Running the code

To run the sampler once

`python l0_sampling.py`

To evaluate the sampler over a large number of trials and plot them

`python count.py`
